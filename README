JAGS VonMises module
====================
This JAGS extension provides the von Mises Distribution, usable for
modeling JAGS models.

Example
-------
.. bugs::
  model {
    for(i in 1:N){
      x[i] ~ dvonmises(m[i], precision)
    }
    precision ~ dgamma(0.1, 0.1)
  }

For more examples, checkout the examples dir in the repository.

Installation
------------

Linux and Mac
"""""""""""""
Use the tarball and install as usual: 
  ./configure && make && sudo make install

Note: It might be necessary to define a different prefix, depending on
where JAGS is copied (i.e. installed), for example:

  ./configure --prefix /usr && make && sudo make install

Windows
"""""""
For Windows we provide precompiled binaries, which come with an
installer. See the releases page for the Windows installer.

Compiling from a cloned repository
----------------------------------
# dependencies (on a clean ubuntu installation)
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool g++

# creating all auxiliary files
autoreconf -fvi

# building
./configure
make

# or, if JAGS has been installed in a different location, e.g. /usr
./configure --prefix /usr
make

# install
sudo make install

Windows Compiling 
"""""""""""""""""

**First, in Linux:**

- For building the module in Windows, it is easiest to use a tarball that
  was created in linux like this (starting from a source clone):

    autoreconf -fvi
    ./configure
    make dist-gzip

- As an alternative to building this tarball yourself from the github
  source, one can use the tarball that is available for the latest release.

- Copy the *.tar.gz file to your msys home directory and continue from
  there.

**Second, in Windows:**

- Install MinGW (MinGW installer including msys):
  http://www.mingw.org
  In MinGW get installer: msys-base is all you need.

- Install TDM-GCC Compiler Suite:
  http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net 
  Use the exact same version of tdm-gcc as has been used to compile your
  JAGS Version on your system. In that case, also don't forget to untick
  the  "Check for updated files on the TDM-GCC server" 
  during the installation proccess of tdm-gcc. 
  For Jags-4.0.0 to Jags-4.1.0 use: 
  tdm64-gcc-4.6.1.exe
  For Jags-4.2.0 use: 
  tdm64-gcc-4.9.2-3.exe
  
- Delete all *.dll.a files int the TDM-GCC Installation, so the
  compiler will link to the static libraries.

- Change path in c:/mingw/msys/1.0/etc/fstab from
  this:     c:/mingw /mingw
  to:       c:/MinGW64 /mingw
  to use TDM-GCC compilers

- Alternatively to TDM-GCC, you could also use Rtools
  (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
  For Jags-4.2.0 use:
  Rtools33.exe

  Change path in c:/mingw/msys/1.0/etc/fstab
  to:       C:/Rtools/mingw_64 /mingw
  to use Rtools compilers

- --> Start msys, extract tarball in your home dir, 
      cd into dir and do the following:

- *Note*: the module needs the JAGS include files and
  the JAGS libraries.
  Therefore use the -L and -I options, as shown below.

- For building 32bit binaries:

  CXX="g++ -m32" \
  ./configure LDFLAGS="-L/c/Progra~1/JAGS/JAGS-4.2.0/i386/bin" CXXFLAGS="-I/c/Progra~1/JAGS/JAGS-4.2.0/include"

  make win32-install

- For building 64bit binaries:

  CXX="g++ -m64" \
  ./configure LDFLAGS="-L/c/Progra~1/JAGS/JAGS-4.2.0/x64/bin" CXXFLAGS="-I/c/Progra~1/JAGS/JAGS-4.2.0/include"

  make win64-install

- Copy the win/win32/vonmises.* or win/win64/vonmises.* 
  files to your JAGS modules directory to enable the module.
  For JAGS-4.2.0 this usually is: 
  x64: C:\Program Files\JAGS\JAGS-4.2.0\x64\modules
  x32: C:\Program Files\JAGS\JAGS-4.2.0\x32\modules

- *Note*: If you compile both 32bit and 64bit don't forget to make clean
  between the building.

- *All Windows commands in one* (for copy paste convenience)

  CXX="g++ -m32" \
  ./configure LDFLAGS="-L/c/Progra~1/JAGS/JAGS-4.2.0/i386/bin" \
  CXXFLAGS="-I/c/Progra~1/JAGS/JAGS-4.2.0/include" && \
  make win32-install && \
  make clean && \
  CXX="g++ -m64" \
  ./configure LDFLAGS="-L/c/Progra~1/JAGS/JAGS-4.2.0/x64/bin" \
  CXXFLAGS="-I/c/Progra~1/JAGS/JAGS-4.2.0/include" &&
  make win64-install && \
  make clean
