General install notes
---------------------
# dependencies (on a clean ubuntu installation)
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool g++

# creating all auxiliary files
autoreconf -fvi

# building
./configure
make

# or, if JAGS has been installed in a different location, e.g. /usr
./configure --prefix /usr
make

# install
sudo make install

Windows Compiling and Installation
----------------------------------

Linux
"""""

# For building the module in Windows it is easiest to use a tarball that
# was created in linux like this (starting from a source clone):
autoreconf -fvi
./configure
make dist-gzip

# Copy the *.tar.gz file to your msys home directory and continue from
# there.

Windows
"""""""

# - Install MinGW (MinGW installer including msys):
#   http://www.mingw.org
#   In MinGW get installer: msys-base is all you need.
#
# - Install TDM-GCC Compiler Suite:
#   http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net 
#   Use the exact same version of tdm-gcc as has been used to compile your
#   JAGS Version on your system. In that case, also don't forget to untick
#   the  "Check for updated files on the TDM-GCC server" 
#   during the installation proccess of tdm-gcc. 
#   For Jags-4.0.0 use: 
#   tdm64-gcc-4.6.3.exe
#   (tdm64-gcc-4.6.1.exe works as well)
#
# - Delete all *.dll.a files int the TDM-GCC Installation, so the
#   compiler will link to the static libraries.
#
# - Change path in c:/mingw/msys/1.0/etc/fstab from
#   this:     c:/mingw /mingw
#   to:       c:/MinGW64 /mingw
#   to use TDM-GCC compilers

# --> Start msys, extract tarball in your home dir, 
#     cd into dir and do the following:

# + Note: the module needs the JAGS include files and
#   the JAGS libraries.
#   Therefore use the -L and -I options, as shown below.

# - For building 32bit binaries
CXX="g++ -m32" \
./configure LDFLAGS="-L/c/Progra~1/JAGS/JAGS-4.0.0/i386/bin" CXXFLAGS="-I/c/Progra~1/JAGS/JAGS-4.0.0/include"

make win32-install

# - For building 64bit binaries
CXX="g++ -m64" \
./configure LDFLAGS="-L/c/Progra~1/JAGS/JAGS-4.0.0/x64/bin" CXXFLAGS="-I/c/Progra~1/JAGS/JAGS-4.0.0/include"

make win64-install

# - Copy the win/inst32/.../vonmises.* or win/inst64/.../vonmises.* 
#   files to your JAGS modules directory to enable the module.
#   For JAGS-4.0.0 this usually is: 
#   x64: C:\Program Files\JAGS\JAGS-4.0.0\x64\modules
#   x32: C:\Program Files\JAGS\JAGS-4.0.0\x32\modules

# + Note: If you compile both 32bit and 64bit don't forget to
make clean
#   between the building.
